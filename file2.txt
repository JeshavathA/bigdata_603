easley hesitantly
. “Are
you sure — ?”
“Of course I am!” said Mr
. W
easley
. “The boys
wouldn’
t do anything like that now
, not when people
are desperate for protection!”
“So is that why you’re late, Metamorph-Medals?”
“No, we got wind of a nasty backfiring jinx down in
Elephant and Castle, but luckily the Magical Law
Enforcement Squad had sorted it out by the time we
got there. …”
Harry stifled a yawn behind his hand.

“Bed,” said an undeceived Mrs. W
easley at once. “I’ve got Fred and
Geor
ge’
s room all ready for you, you’ll
have it to yourself.”
“Why
, where are they?”
“Oh, they’re in Diagon Alley
, sleeping in the little flat
over their joke shop as they’re so busy
,” said Mrs.
W
easley
. “I must say
, I didn’
t approve at first, but
they do seem to have a bit of a flair for business!

Come on, dear
, your trunk’
s already up there.”
“ ’Night, Mr
. W
easley
,” said Harry
, pushing back his
chair
. Crookshanks leapt lightly from his lap and
slunk out of the room.
“G’night, Harry
,” said Mr
. W
easley
.
Harry saw Mrs. W
easley glance at the clock in the
washing basket as they left the kitchen. All the hands
were once again at “mortal peril.”
Fred and Geor
ge’
s bedroom was on the second floor
.
Mrs. W
easley pointed her wand at a lamp on the
bedside table and it ignited at once, bathing the room
in a pleasant golden glow
. Though a lar
ge vase of
flowers had been placed on a desk in front of the
small window
, their perfume could not disguise the
lingering smell of what Harry thought was
gunpowder
. A considerable amount of floor space was
devoted to a vast number of unmarked, sealed
cardboard boxes, amongst which stood Harry’
s school
trunk. The room looked as though it was being used
as a temporary warehouse.

of a lar

night, put on pajamas, and got into one of the beds.
There was something hard inside the pillowcase. He
groped inside it and pulled out a sticky purple-and-
orange sweet, which he recognized as a Puking
Pastille. Smiling to himself, he rolled over and was
instantly asleep.
Seconds later
, or so it seemed to Harry
, he was
awakened by what sounded like cannon fire as the
door burst open. Sitting bolt upright, he heard the
rasp of the curtains being pulled back: The dazzling
sunlight seemed to poke him hard in both eyes.
Shielding them with one hand, he groped hopelessly
for his glasses with the other
.
“W
uzzgoinon?”
www.ztcprep.com
“W
e didn’
t know you were here already!” said a loud
and excited voice, and he received a sharp blow to the
top of the head.
“Ron, don’
t hit him!” said a girl’
s voice reproachfully
.
Harry’
s hand found his glasses and he shoved them
on, though the light was so bright he could hardly see
anyway
. A long, looming shadow quivered in front of
him for a moment; he blinked and Ron W
easley came
into focus, grinning down at him.
“All right?”
“Never been better
,” said Harry
, rubbing the top of his
head and slumping back onto his pillows. “Y
ou?”
“Not bad,” said Ron, pulling over a cardboard box and
sitting on it. “When did you get here? Mum’
s only just
told us!”
“About one o’clock this morning.”

“W
ere the Muggles all right? Did they treat you okay?”
“Same as usual,” said Harry
, as Hermione perched
www.ztcprep.com
herself on the edge of his bed, “they didn’
t talk to me
much, but I like it better that way
. How’re you,
Hermione?”
“Oh, I’m fine,” said Hermione, who was scrutinizing
Harry as though he was sickening for something. He
thought he knew what was behind this, and as he
had no wish to discuss Sirius’
s death or any other
miserable subject at the moment, he said, “What’
s the
time? Have I missed breakfast?”
“Don’
t worry about that, Mum’
s bringing you up a
tray; she reckons you look underfed,” said Ron,
rolling his eyes. “So, what’
s been going on?”
“Nothing much, I’ve just been stuck at my aunt and
uncle’
s, haven’
t I?”
“Come of
f it!” said Ron. “Y
ou’ve been of
f with
Dumbledore!”
“It wasn’
t that exciting. He just wanted me to help
him persuade this old teacher to come out of
retirement. His name’
s Horace Slughorn.”
“Oh,” said Ron, looking disappointed. “W
e thought —”
www.ztcprep.com
Hermione flashed a warning look at Ron, and Ron
changed tack at top speed.
“— we thought it’d be something like that.”
“Y
ou did?” said Harry
, amused.

“Y
eah … yeah, now Umbridge has left, obviously we
need a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher
,
don’
t we? So, er
, what’
s he like?”
“He looks a bit like a walrus, and he used to be Head
of Slytherin,” said Harry
. “Something wrong,
Hermione?”
She was watching him as though expecting strange
symptoms to manifest themselves at any moment.
She rearranged her features hastily in an
unconvincing smile.
“No, of course not! So, um, did Slughorn seem like
he’ll be a good teacher?”
“Dunno,” said Harry
. “He can’
t be worse than
Umbridge, can he?”
www.ztcprep.com
“I know someone who’
s worse than Umbridge,” said a
voice from the doorway
. Ron’
s younger sister slouched
into the room, looking irritable. “Hi, Harry
.”
“What’
s up with you?” Ron asked.
“It’
s 
her
, 
” said Ginny
, plonking herself down on
Harry’
s bed. “She’
s driving me mad.”
“What’
s she done now?” asked Hermione
sympathetically
.
“It’
s the way she talks to me — you’d think I was
about three!”
“I know
,” said Hermione, dropping her voice. “She’
s so
full of herself.”
Harry was astonished to hear Hermione talking about
Mrs. W
easley like this and could not blame Ron for
P a g e

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
saying angrily
, “Can’
t you two lay of
f her for five seconds?”
“Oh, that’
s right, defend her
,” snapped Ginny
. “W
e all
know you can’
t get enough of her
.”
This seemed an odd comment to make about Ron’
s
www.ztcprep.com
mother
. Starting to feel that he was missing
something, Harry said, “Who are you — ?”
But his question was answered before he could finish
it. The bedroom door flew open again, and Harry
instinctively yanked the bedcovers up to his chin so
hard that Hermione and Ginny slid of
f the bed onto
the floor
.
A young woman was standing in the doorway
, a
woman of such breathtaking beauty that the room
seemed to have become strangely airless. She was tall
and willowy with long blonde hair and appeared to
emanate a faint, silvery glow
. T
o complete this vision
of perfection, she was carrying a heavily laden
breakfast tray
.
“ ’Arry
,” she said in a throaty voice. “Eet ’as been too
long!”
As she swept over the threshold toward him, Mrs.
W
easley was revealed, bobbing along in her wake,
looking rather cross.
“There was no need to bring up the tray
, I was just
www.ztcprep.com
about to do it myself!”
“Eet was no trouble,” said Fleur Delacour
, setting the
tray across Harry’
s knees and then swooping to kiss
him on each cheek: He felt the places where her
mouth had touched him burn. “I ’ave been longing to
see ’im. Y
ou remember my seester
, Gabrielle? She
P a g e 
| 102
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
never stops talking about ’Arry Potter
. She will be delighted to see you
again.”
“Oh … is she here too?” Harry croaked.
“No, no, silly boy
,” said Fleur with a tinkling laugh, “I
mean next summer
, when we — but do you not
know?”
Her great blue eyes widened and she looked
reproachfully at Mrs. W
easley
, who said, “W
e hadn’
t
got around to telling him yet.”
Fleur turned back to Harry
, swinging her silvery sheet
of hair so that it whipped Mrs. W
easley across the
face.
“Bill and I are going to be married!”
www.ztcprep.com
“Oh,” said Harry blankly
. He could not help noticing
how Mrs. W
easley
, Hermione, and Ginny were all
determinedly avoiding one another
’
s gaze. “W
ow
. Er
— congratulations!”
She swooped down upon him and kissed him again.
“Bill is very busy at ze moment, working very ’ard,
and I only work part-time at Gringotts for my
Eenglish, so he brought me ’ere for a few days to get
to know ’is family properly
. I was so pleased to ’ear
you would be coming — zere isn’
t much to do ’ere,
unless you like cooking and chickens! W
ell — enjoy
your breakfast, ’Arry!”
W
ith these words she turned gracefully and seemed to
float out of the room, closing the door quietly behind
her
.
Mrs. W
easley made a noise that sounded like “tchah!”
P a g e

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
“Mum hates her
,” said Ginny quietly
.
“I do not hate her!” said Mrs. W
easley in a cross
www.ztcprep.com
whisper
. “I just think they’ve hurried into this
engagement, that’
s all!”
“They’ve known each other a year
,” said Ron, who
looked oddly groggy and was staring at the closed
door
.
“W
ell, that’
s not very long! I know why it’
s happened,
of course. It’
s all this uncertainty with Y
ou-Know-Who
coming back, people think they might be dead
tomorrow
, so they’re rushing all sorts of decisions
they’d normally take time over
. It was the same last
time he was powerful, people eloping left, right, and
center —”
“Including you and Dad,” said Ginny slyly
.
“Y
es, well, your father and I were made for each other
,
what was the point in waiting?” said Mrs. W
easley
.
“Whereas Bill and Fleur … well … what have they
really got in common? He’
s a hardworking, down-to-
earth sort of person, whereas she’
s —”
“A cow
,” said Ginny
, nodding. “But Bill’
s not that
down-to-earth. He’
s a Curse-Breaker
, isn’
t he, he
www.ztcprep.com
likes a bit of adventure, a bit of glamour
. … I expect
that’
s why he’
s gone for Phlegm.”
“Stop calling her that, Ginny
,” said Mrs. W
easley
sharply
, as Harry and Hermione laughed. “W
ell, I’d
better get on. … Eat your eggs while they’re warm,
Harry
.”
Looking careworn, she left the room. Ron still seemed
slightly punch-drunk; he was shaking his head
P a g e 
| 104
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
experimentally like a dog trying to rid its ears of water
.
“Don’
t you get used to her if she’
s staying in the same
house?” Harry asked.
“W
ell, you do,” said Ron, “but if she jumps out at you
unexpectedly
, like then …”
“It’
s pathetic,” said Hermione furiously
, striding away
from Ron as far as she could go and turning to face
him with her arms folded once she had reached the
wall.
“Y
ou don’
t really want her around forever?” Ginny
www.ztcprep.com
asked Ron incredulously
. When he merely shrugged,
she said, “W
ell, Mum’
s going to put a stop to it if she
can, I bet you anything.”
“How’
s she going to manage that?” asked Harry
.
“She keeps trying to get T
onks round for dinner
. I
think she’
s hoping Bill will fall for T
onks instead. I
hope he does, I’d much rather have her in the family
.”
“Y
eah, that’ll work,” said Ron sarcastically
. “Listen,
no bloke in his right mind’
s going to fancy T
onks
when Fleur
’
s around. I mean, T
onks is okay-looking
when she isn’
t doing stupid things to her hair and her
nose, but —”
“She’
s a damn sight nicer than 
Phlegm, 
’
’ said Ginny
“And she’
s more intelligent, she’
s an Auror!” said
Hermione from the corner
.
“Fleur
’
s not stupid, she was good enough to enter the
T
riwizard T
ournament,” said Harry
.
P a g e

“Not you as well!” said Hermione bitterly
.
www.ztcprep.com
“I suppose you like the way Phlegm says ‘’Arry
,’ do
you?” asked Ginny scornfully
.
“No,” said Harry
, wishing he hadn’
t spoken, “I was
just saying, Phlegm — I mean, Fleur —”
“I’d much rather have T
onks in the family
,” said
Ginny
. “At least she’
s a laugh.”
“She hasn’
t been much of a laugh lately
,” said Ron.
“Every time I’ve seen her she’
s looked more like
Moaning Myrtle.”
“That’
s not fair
,” snapped Hermione. “She still hasn’
t
got over what happened … you know … I mean, he
was her cousin!”
Harry’
s heart sank. They had arrived at Sirius. He
picked up a fork and began shoveling scrambled eggs
into his mouth, hoping to deflect any invitation to join
in this part of the conversation.
“T
onks and Sirius barely knew each other!” said Ron.
“Sirius was in Azkaban half her life and before that
their families never met —”
“That’
s not the point,” said Hermione. “She thinks it
www.ztcprep.com
was her fault he died!”
“How does she work that one out?” asked Harry
, in
spite of himself.
“W
ell, she was fighting Bellatrix Lestrange, wasn’
t
she? I think she feels that if only she had finished her
of
f, Bellatrix couldn’
t have killed Sirius.”
“That’
s stupid,” said Ron.
P a g e

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
“It’
s survivor
’
s guilt,” said Hermione. “I know Lupin’
s tried to talk her
round, but she’
s still really down.
She’
s actually having trouble with her
Metamorphosing!”
“W
ith her — ?”
“She can’
t change her appearance like she used to,”
explained Hermione. “I think her powers must have
been af
fected by shock, or something.”
“I didn’
t know that could happen,” said Harry
.
“Nor did I,” said Hermione, “but I suppose if you’re
really depressed …”
The door opened again and Mrs. W
easley popped her
www.ztcprep.com
head in. “Ginny
,” she whispered, “come downstairs
and help me with the lunch.”
“I’m talking to this lot!” said Ginny
, outraged.
“Now!” said Mrs. W
easley
, and withdrew
.
“She only wants me there so she doesn’
t have to be
alone with Phlegm!” said Ginny crossly
. She swung
her long red hair around in a very good imitation of
Fleur and pranced across the room with her arms
held aloft like a ballerina.
“Y
ou lot had better come down quickly too,” she said
as she left.
Harry took advantage of the temporary silence to eat
more breakfast. Hermione was peering into Fred and
Geor
ge’
s boxes, though every now and then she cast
sideways looks at Harry
. Ron, who was now helping
himself to Harry’
s toast, was still gazing dreamily at
the door
.
P a g e

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
“What’
s this?” Hermione asked eventually
, holding up what looked like a
small telescope.
www.ztcprep.com
“Dunno,” said Ron, “but if Fred and Geor
ge’ve left it
here, it’
s probably not ready for the joke shop yet, so
be careful.”
“Y
our mum said the shop’
s going well,” said Harry
.
“Said Fred and Geor
ge have got a real flair for
business.”
“That’
s an understatement,” said Ron. “They’re raking
in the Galleons! I can’
t wait to see the place, we
haven’
t been to Diagon Alley yet, because Mum says
Dad’
s got to be there for extra security and he’
s been
really busy at work, but it sounds excellent.”
“And what about Percy?” asked Harry; the third-
eldest W
easley brother had fallen out with the rest of
the family
. “Is he talking to your mum and dad
again?”
“Nope,” said Ron.
“But he knows your dad was right all along now
about V
oldemort being back —”
“Dumbledore says people find it far easier to for
give
others for being wrong than being right,” said
www.ztcprep.com
Hermione. “I heard him telling your mum, Ron.”
“Sounds like the sort of mental thing Dumbledore
would say
,” said Ron.
“He’
s going to be giving me private lessons this year
,”
said Harry conversationally
.
Ron choked on his bit of toast, and Hermione gasped.
P a g e 
| 108
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
“Y
ou kept that quiet!” said Ron.
“I only just remembered,” said Harry honestly
. “He
told me last night in your broom shed.”
“Blimey … private lessons with Dumbledore!” said
Ron, looking impressed. “I wonder why he’
s … ?”
His voice tailed away
. Harry saw him and Hermione
exchange looks. Harry laid down his knife and fork,
his heart beating rather fast considering that all he
was doing was sitting in bed. Dumbledore had said to
do it. … Why not now? He fixed his eyes on his fork,
which was gleaming in the sunlight streaming into his
lap, and said, “I don’
t know exactly why he’
s going to
www.ztcprep.com
be giving me lessons, but I think it must be because
of the prophecy
.”
Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke. Harry had the
impression that both had frozen. He continued, still
speaking to his fork, “Y
ou know
, the one they were
trying to steal at the Ministry
.”
“Nobody knows what it said, though,” said Hermione
quickly
. “It got smashed.”
“Although the 
Pr
ophet
 says —” began Ron, but
Hermione said, “Shh!”
“The 
Pr
ophet’
s
 got it right,” said Harry
, looking up at
them both with a great ef
fort: Hermione seemed
frightened and Ron amazed. “That glass ball that
smashed wasn’
t the only record of the prophecy
. I
heard the whole thing in Dumbledore’
s of
fice, he was
the one the prophecy was made to, so he could tell
me. From what it said,” Harry took a deep breath, “it
looks like I’m the one who’
s got to finish of
f
V
oldemort. … At least, it said neither of us could live
while the other survives.”

The three of them gazed at one another in silence for a moment. Then there
was a loud bang and Hermione
vanished behind a puf
f of black smoke.
“Hermione!” shouted Harry and Ron; the breakfast
tray slid to the floor with a crash.
Hermione emer
ged, coughing, out of the smoke,
clutching the telescope and sporting a brilliantly
purple black eye.
“I squeezed it and it — it punched me!” she gasped.
And sure enough, they now saw a tiny fist on a long
spring protruding from the end of the telescope.
“Don’
t worry
,” said Ron, who was plainly trying not to
laugh, “Mum’ll fix that, she’
s good at healing minor
injuries —”
“Oh well, never mind that now!” said Hermione
hastily
. “Harry
, oh, Harry …”
She sat down on the edge of his bed again.
“W
e wondered, after we got back from the Ministry …
Obviously
, we didn’
t want to say anything to you, but
www.ztcprep.com
from what Lucius Malfoy said about the prophecy
,
how it was about you and V
oldemort, well, we
thought it might be something like this. … Oh, Harry
…” She stared at him, then whispered, “Are you
scared?”
“Not as much as I was,” said Harry
. “When I first
heard it, I was … but now
, it seems as though I
always knew I’d have to face him in the end. …”
“When we heard Dumbledore was collecting you in
person, we thought he might be telling you something
P a g e 
| 1

Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
or showing you something to do with the prophecy
,”
said Ron eagerly
. “And we were kind of right, weren’
t
we? He wouldn’
t be giving you lessons if he thought
you were a goner
, wouldn’
t waste his time — he must
think you’ve got a chance!”
“That’
s true,” said Hermione. “I wonder what he’ll
teach you, Harry? Really advanced defensive magic,
probably … powerful countercurses … anti-jinxes …”
www.ztcprep.com
Harry did not really listen. A warmth was spreading
through him that had nothing to do with the sunlight;
a tight obstruction in his chest seemed to be
dissolving. He knew that Ron and Hermione were
more shocked than they were letting on, but the mere
fact that they were still there on either side of him,
speaking bracing words of comfort, not shrinking
from him as though he were contaminated or
dangerous, was worth more than he could ever tell
them.
“… and evasive enchantments generally
,” concluded
Hermione. “W
ell, at least you know one lesson you’ll
be having this year
, that’
s one more than Ron and
me. I wonder when our O.W
.L. results will come?”
“Can’
t be long now
, it’
s been a month,” said Ron.
“Hang on,” said Harry
, as another part of last night’
s
conversation came back to him. “I think Dumbledore
said our O.W
.L. results would be arriving today!”
“T
oday?” shrieked Hermione. “
T
oday
? But why didn’
t
you — oh my God — you should have said —”
www.ztcprep.com
She leapt to her feet.
“I’m going to see whether any owls have come. …”

But when Harry arrived downstairs ten minutes later
, fully dressed and
carrying his empty breakfast tray
, it
was to find Hermione sitting at the kitchen table in
great agitation, while Mrs. W
easley tried to lessen her
resemblance to half a panda.
“It just won’
t budge,” Mrs. W
easley was saying
anxiously
, standing over Hermione with her wand in
her hand and a copy of 
The
 
Healer
’
s Helpmate
 open at
“Bruises, Cuts, and Abrasions.” “This has always
worked before, I just can’
t understand it.”
“It’ll be Fred and Geor
ge’
s idea of a funny joke,
making sure it can’
t come of
f,” said Ginny
“But it’
s got to come of
f!” squeaked Hermione. “I can’
t
go around looking like this forever!”
“Y
ou won’
t, dear
, we’ll find an antidote, don’
t worry
,”
said Mrs. W
easley soothingly
.
“Bill told me ’ow Fred and Geor
ge are very amusing!”
www.ztcprep.com
said Fleur
, smiling serenely
.
“Y
es, I can hardly breathe for laughing,” snapped
Hermione.
She jumped up and started walking round and round
the kitchen, twisting her fingers together
.
“Mrs. W
easley
, you’re quite, quite sure no owls have
arrived this morning?”
“Y
es, dear
, I’d have noticed,” said Mrs. W
easley
patiently
. “But it’
s barely nine, there’
s still plenty of
time. …”
“I know I messed up Ancient Runes,” muttered
Hermione feverishly
, “I definitely made at least one

serious mistranslation. And the Defense Against the Dark Arts practical was
no good at all. I thought
T
ransfiguration went all right at the time, but looking
back —”
“Hermione, will you shut up, you’re not the only one
who’
s nervous!” barked Ron. “And when you’ve got
your eleven ‘Outstanding’ O.W
.L.s …”
www.ztcprep.com
“Don’
t, don’
t, don’
t!” said Hermione, flapping her
hands hysterically
. “I know I’ve failed everything!”
“What happens if we fail?” Harry asked the room at
lar
ge, but it was again Hermione who answered.
“W
e discuss our options with our Head of House, I
asked Professor McGonagall at the end of last term.”
Harry’
s stomach squirmed. He wished he had eaten
less breakfast.
“At Beauxbatons,” said Fleur complacently
, “we ’ad a
dif
ferent way of doing things. I think eet was better
.
W
e sat our examinations after six years of study
, not
five, and then —”
Fleur
’
s words were drowned in a scream. Hermione
was pointing through the kitchen window
. Three
black specks were clearly visible in the sky
, growing
lar
ger all the time.
“They’re definitely owls,” said Ron hoarsely
, jumping
up to join Hermione at the window
.
“And there are three of them,” said Harry
, hastening
to her other side.
www.ztcprep.com
“One for each of us,” said Hermione in a terrified
whisper
. “Oh no … oh no … oh no …”

She gripped both Harry and Ron tightly around the
elbows.
The owls were flying directly at the Burrow
, three
handsome tawnies, each of which, it became clear as
they flew lower over the path leading up to the house,
was carrying a lar
ge square envelope.
“Oh 
no
!” squealed Hermione.
Mrs. W
easley squeezed past them and opened the
kitchen window
. One, two, three, the owls soared
through it and landed on the table in a neat line. All
three of them lifted their right legs.
Harry moved forward. The letter addressed to him
was tied to the leg of the owl in the middle. He untied
it with fumbling fingers. T
o his left, Ron was trying to
detach his own results; to his right, Hermione’
s
hands were shaking so much she was making her
www.ztcprep.com
whole owl tremble.
Nobody in the kitchen spoke. At last, Harry managed
to detach the envelope. He slit it open quickly and
unfolded the parchment inside.

Harry read the parchment through several times, his
breathing becoming easier with each reading. It was
all right: He had always known that he would fail
Divination, and he had had no chance of passing
History of Magic, given that he had collapsed halfway
through the examination, but he had passed
everything else! He ran his finger down the grades …
he had passed well in T
ransfiguration and Herbology
,

he had even exceeded expectations at Potions! And
best of all, he had achieved “Outstanding” at Defense
Against the Dark Arts!
He looked around. Hermione had her back to him and
her head bent, but Ron was looking delighted.
“Only failed Divination and History of Magic, and who
cares about them?” he said happily to Harry
. “Here —
swap —”
Harry glanced down Ron’
s grades: There were no
“Outstandings” there. …
“Knew you’d be top at Defense Against the Dark Arts,”
said Ron, punching Harry on the shoulder
. “W
e’ve
done all right, haven’
t we?”

“Hermione?” said Ginny tentatively
, for Hermione still hadn’
t turned
around. “How did you do?”
“I — not bad,” said Hermione in a small voice.

“Oh, come of
f it,” said Ron, striding over to her and
whipping her results out of her hand. “Y
ep — nine
‘Outstandings’ and one ‘Exceeds Expectations’ at
Defense Against the Dark Arts.” He looked down at
her
, half-amused, half-exasperated. “Y
ou’re actually
disappointed, aren’
t you?”
Hermione shook her head, but Harry laughed.
“W
ell, we’re N.E.W
.T
. students now!” grinned Ron.
“Mum, are there any more sausages?”
Harry looked back down at his results. They were as
good as he could have hoped for
. He felt just one tiny
twinge of regret. … This was the end of his ambition
to become an Auror
. He had not secured the required
Potions grade. He had known all along that he
wouldn’
t, but he still felt a sinking in his stomach as
he looked again at that small black E.
It was odd, really
, seeing that it had been a Death
Eater in disguise who had first told Harry he would
make a good Auror
, but somehow the idea had taken
hold of him, and he couldn’
t really think of anything

else he would like to be. Moreover
, it had seemed the
right destiny for him since he had heard the prophecy
a few weeks ago. … 
Neither can live while the other
survives. …
 W
ouldn’
t he be living up to the prophecy
,
and giving himself the best chance of survival, if he
joined those highly trained wizards whose job it was
to find and kill V
oldemort?

OUR
Harry remained within the confines of the Burrow’
s
garden over the next few weeks. He spent most of his
days playing two-a-side Quidditch in the W
easleys’
orchard (he and Hermione against Ron and Ginny;
www.ztcprep.com
Hermione was dreadful and Ginny good, so they were
reasonably well matched) and his evenings eating
triple helpings of everything Mrs. W
easley put in front
of him.
It would have been a happy
, peaceful holiday had it
not been for the stories of disappearances, odd
accidents, even of deaths now appearing almost daily
in the 
Pr
ophet. 
Sometimes Bill and Mr
. W
easley
brought home news before it even reached the paper
.
T
o Mrs. W
easley’
s displeasure, Harry’
s sixteenth
birthday celebrations were marred by grisly tidings
brought to the party by Remus Lupin, who was
looking gaunt and grim, his brown hair streaked
liberally with gray
, his clothes more ragged and
patched than ever
.

“There have been another couple of dementor

Eaters; Sirius’

days as far as I can remember

“Y

, frowning, “perhaps we
should talk about something dif

“Did you hear about Florean Fortescue, Remus?”
asked Bill, who was being plied with wine by Fleur
.
“The man who ran —”
“— the ice-cream place in Diagon Alley?” Harry
interrupted, with an unpleasant, hollow sensation in
the pit of his stomach. “He used to give me free ice
creams. What’
s happened to him?”
“Dragged of

“Why?” asked Ron, while Mrs. W
easley pointedly
glared at Bill.
“Who knows? He must’ve upset them somehow

was a good man, Florean.”
