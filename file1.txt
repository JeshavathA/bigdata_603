“Cissy
, your own sister? Y
ou wouldn’
t —”
“There is nothing I wouldn’
t do anymore!” Narcissa
breathed, a note of hysteria in her voice, and as she
brought down the wand like a knife, there was
another flash of light. Bella let go of her sister
’
s arm
as though burned.

“
Nar
cissa
!”
But Narcissa had rushed ahead. Rubbing her hand,
her pursuer followed again, keeping her distance now
,
as they moved deeper into the deserted labyrinth of
brick houses. At last, Narcissa hurried up a street
named Spinner
’
s End, over which the towering mill
chimney seemed to hover like a giant admonitory
finger
. Her footsteps echoed on the cobbles as she
passed boarded and broken windows, until she
reached the very last house, where a dim light
glimmered through the curtains in a downstairs
room.

She had knocked on the door before Bella, cursing
under her breath, had caught up. T
ogether they stood
waiting, panting slightly
, breathing in the smell of the
dirty river that was carried to them on the night
breeze. After a few seconds, they heard movement
behind the door and it opened a crack. A sliver of a
man could be seen looking out at them, a man with
long black hair parted in curtains around a sallow
face and black eyes.
Narcissa threw back her hood. She was so pale that
she seemed to shine in the darkness; the long blonde
hair streaming down her back gave her the look of a
drowned person.
“Narcissa!” said the man, opening the door a little
wider
, so that the light fell upon her and her sister
too. “What a pleasant surprise!”
“Severus,” she said in a strained whisper
. “May I
speak to you? It’
s ur
gent.”
“But of course.”

He stood back to allow her to pass him into the
house. Her still-hooded sister followed without
invitation.
“Snape,” she said curtly as she passed him.
“Bellatrix,” he replied, his thin mouth curling into a
slightly mocking smile as he closed the door with a
snap behind them.
They had stepped directly into a tiny sitting room,
which had the feeling of a dark, padded cell. The walls
were completely covered in books, most of them
bound in old black or brown leather; a threadbare
sofa, an old armchair
, and a rickety table stood
grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a
candle-filled lamp hung from the ceiling. The place
had an air of neglect, as though it was not usually
inhabited.
Snape gestured Narcissa to the sofa. She threw of
f
her cloak, cast it aside, and sat down, staring at her
white and trembling hands clasped in her lap.

Bellatrix lowered her hood more slowly
. Dark as her
sister was fair
, with heavily lidded eyes and a strong
jaw
, she did not take her gaze from Snape as she
moved to stand behind Narcissa.
“So, what can I do for you?” Snape asked, settling
himself in the armchair opposite the two sisters.
“W
e … we are alone, aren’
t we?” Narcissa asked
quietly
.
“Y
es, of course. W
ell, W
ormtail’
s here, but we’re not
counting vermin, are we?”
He pointed his wand at the wall of books behind him
and with a bang, a hidden door flew open, revealing a
P a g e 
| 26
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
narrow staircase upon which a small man stood
frozen.
“As you have clearly realized, W
ormtail, we have
guests,” said Snape lazily
.
The man crept, hunchbacked, down the last few steps
and moved into the room. He had small, watery eyes,
www.ztcprep.com
a pointed nose, and wore an unpleasant simper
. His
left hand was caressing his right, which looked as
though it was encased in a bright silver glove.
“Narcissa!” he said, in a squeaky voice. “And Bellatrix!
How charming —”
“W
ormtail will get us drinks, if you’d like them,” said
Snape. “And then he will return to his bedroom.”
W
ormtail winced as though Snape had thrown
something at him.
“I am not your servant!” he squeaked, avoiding
Snape’
s eye.
“Really? I was under the impression that the Dark
Lord placed you here to assist me.”
“T
o assist, yes — but not to make you drinks and —
and clean your house!”
“I had no idea, W
ormtail, that you were craving more
dangerous assignments,” said Snape silkily
. “This can
be easily arranged: I shall speak to the Dark Lord —”
“I can speak to him myself if I want to!”
“Of course you can,” said Snape, sneering. “But in the
www.ztcprep.com
meantime, bring us drinks. Some of the elf-made wine
will do.”
P a g e

W
ormtail hesitated for a moment, looking as though
he might ar
gue, but then turned and headed through
a second hidden door
. They heard banging and a
clinking of glasses. W
ithin seconds he was back,
bearing a dusty bottle and three glasses upon a tray
.
He dropped these on the rickety table and scurried
from their presence, slamming the book-covered door
behind him.
Snape poured out three glasses of bloodred wine and
handed two of them to the sisters. Narcissa
murmured a word of thanks, whilst Bellatrix said
nothing, but continued to glower at Snape. This did
not seem to discompose him; on the contrary
, he
looked rather amused.
“The Dark Lord,” he said, raising his glass and
draining it.
www.ztcprep.com
The sisters copied him. Snape refilled their glasses.
As Narcissa took her second drink she said in a rush,
“Severus, I’m sorry to come here like this, but I had to
see you. I think you are the only one who can help me
—”
Snape held up a hand to stop her
, then pointed his
wand again at the concealed staircase door
. There
was a loud bang and a squeal, followed by the sound
of W
ormtail scurrying back up the stairs.
“My apologies,” said Snape. “He has lately taken to
listening at doors, I don’
t know what he means by it.
… Y
ou were saying, Narcissa?”
She took a great, shuddering breath and started
again.
“Severus, I know I ought not to be here, I have been
told to say nothing to anyone, but —”
P a g e 
| 28
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
“Then you ought to hold your tongue!” snarled
Bellatrix. “Particularly in present company!”
www.ztcprep.com
“ ‘Present company’?” repeated Snape sardonically
.
“And what am I to understand by that, Bellatrix?”
“That I don’
t trust you, Snape, as you very well
know!”
Narcissa let out a noise that might have been a dry
sob and covered her face with her hands. Snape set
his glass down upon the table and sat back again, his
hands upon the arms of his chair
, smiling into
Bellatrix’
s glowering face.
“Narcissa, I think we ought to hear what Bellatrix is
bursting to say; it will save tedious interruptions.
W
ell, continue, Bellatrix,” said Snape. “Why is it that
you do not trust me?”
“A hundred reasons!” she said loudly
, striding out
from behind the sofa to slam her glass upon the table.
“Where to start! Where were you when the Dark Lord
fell? Why did you never make any attempt to find him
when he vanished? What have you been doing all
these years that you’ve lived in Dumbledore’
s pocket?
Why did you stop the Dark Lord procuring the
www.ztcprep.com
Sorcerer
’
s Stone? Why did you not return at once
when the Dark Lord was reborn? Where were you a
few weeks ago when we battled to retrieve the
prophecy for the Dark Lord? And why
, Snape, is
Harry Potter still alive, when you have had him at
your mercy for five years?”
She paused, her chest rising and falling rapidly
, the
color high in her cheeks. Behind her
, Narcissa sat
motionless, her face still hidden in her hands.
Snape smiled.

“Before I answer you — oh yes, Bellatrix, I am going to answer! Y
ou can
carry my words back to the others
who whisper behind my back, and carry false tales of
my treachery to the Dark Lord! Before I answer you, I
say
, let me ask a question in turn. Do you really think
that the Dark Lord has not asked me each and every
one of those questions? And do you really think that,
had I not been able to give satisfactory answers, I
would be sitting here talking to you?”
www.ztcprep.com
She hesitated.
“I know he believes you, but …”
“Y
ou think he is mistaken? Or that I have somehow
hoodwinked him? Fooled the Dark Lord, the greatest
wizard, the most accomplished Legilimens the world
has ever seen?”
Bellatrix said nothing, but looked, for the first time, a
little discomfited. Snape did not press the point. He
picked up his drink again, sipped it, and continued,
“Y
ou ask where I was when the Dark Lord fell. I was
where he had ordered me to be, at Hogwarts School of
W
itchcraft and W
izardry
, because he wished me to
spy upon Albus Dumbledore. Y
ou know
, I presume,
that it was on the Dark Lord’
s orders that I took up
the post?”
She nodded almost imperceptibly and then opened
her mouth, but Snape forestalled her
.
“Y
ou ask why I did not attempt to find him when he
vanished. For the same reason that A
very
, Y
axley
, the
Carrows, Greyback, Lucius” — he inclined his head
www.ztcprep.com
slightly to Narcissa — “and many others did not
attempt to find him. I believed him finished. I am not
proud of it, I was wrong, but there it is. … If he had
P a g e

not for
given we who lost faith at that time, he would have very few
followers left.”
“He’d have me!” said Bellatrix passionately
. “I, who
spent many years in Azkaban for him!”
“Y
es, indeed, most admirable,” said Snape in a bored
voice. “Of course, you weren’
t a lot of use to him in
prison, but the gesture was undoubtedly fine —”
“Gesture!” she shrieked; in her fury she looked
slightly mad. “While I endured the dementors, you
remained at Hogwarts, comfortably playing
Dumbledore’
s pet!”
“Not quite,” said Snape calmly
. “He wouldn’
t give me
the Defense Against the Dark Arts job, you know
.
Seemed to think it might, ah, bring about a relapse …
tempt me into my old ways.”
“This was your sacrifice for the Dark Lord, not to
www.ztcprep.com
teach your favorite subject?” she jeered. “Why did you
stay there all that time, Snape? Still spying on
Dumbledore for a master you believed dead?”
“Hardly
,” said Snape, “although the Dark Lord is
pleased that I never deserted my post: I had sixteen
years of information on Dumbledore to give him when
he returned, a rather more useful welcome-back
present than endless reminiscences of how
unpleasant Azkaban is. …”
“But you stayed —”
“Y
es, Bellatrix, I stayed,” said Snape, betraying a hint
of impatience for the first time. “I had a comfortable
job that I preferred to a stint in Azkaban. They were
rounding up the Death Eaters, you know
.
Dumbledore’
s protection kept me out of jail; it was
P a g e 
| 31
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
most convenient and I used it. I repeat: The Dark
Lord does not complain that I stayed, so I do not see
why you do.
www.ztcprep.com
“I think you next wanted to know
,” he pressed on, a
little more loudly
, for Bellatrix showed every sign of
interrupting, “why I stood between the Dark Lord and
the Sorcerer
’
s Stone. That is easily answered. He did
not know whether he could trust me. He thought, like
you, that I had turned from faithful Death Eater to
Dumbledore’
s stooge. He was in a pitiable condition,
very weak, sharing the body of a mediocre wizard. He
did not dare reveal himself to a former ally if that ally
might turn him over to Dumbledore or the Ministry
. I
deeply regret that he did not trust me. He would have
returned to power three years sooner
. As it was, I saw
only greedy and unworthy Quirrell attempting to steal
the stone and, I admit, I did all I could to thwart him.”
Bellatrix’
s mouth twisted as though she had taken an
unpleasant dose of medicine.
“But you didn’
t return when he came back, you didn’
t
fly back to him at once when you felt the Dark Mark
burn —”
“Correct. I returned two hours later
. I returned on
www.ztcprep.com
Dumbledore’
s orders.”
“On Dumbledore’
s — ?” she began, in tones of
outrage.
“Think!” said Snape, impatient again. “Think! By
waiting two hours, just two hours, I ensured that I
could remain at Hogwarts as a spy! By allowing
Dumbledore to think that I was only returning to the
Dark Lord’
s side because I was ordered to, I have
been able to pass information on Dumbledore and the
Order of the Phoenix ever since! Consider
, Bellatrix:
P a g e 
| 32
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling
The Dark Mark had been growing stronger for
months. I knew he must be about to return, all the
Death Eaters knew! I had plenty of time to think
about what I wanted to do, to plan my next move, to
escape like Karkarof
f, didn’
t I?
“The Dark Lord’
s initial displeasure at my lateness
vanished entirely
, I assure you, when I explained that
I remained faithful, although Dumbledore thought I
www.ztcprep.com
was his man. Y
es, the Dark Lord thought that I had
left him forever
, but he was wrong.”
“But what use have you been?” sneered Bellatrix.
“What useful information have we had from you?”
“My information has been conveyed directly to the
Dark Lord,” said Snape. “If he chooses not to share it
with you —”
“He shares everything with me!” said Bellatrix, firing
up at once. “He calls me his most loyal, his most
faithful —”
“Does he?” said Snape, his voice delicately inflected to
suggest his disbelief. “Does he 
still, 
after the fiasco at the Ministry?”
“That was not my fault!” said Bellatrix, flushing. “The
Dark Lord has, in the past, entrusted me with his
most precious — if Lucius hadn’
t —”
“Don’
t you dare — don’
t you 
dar
e
 blame my
husband!” said Narcissa, in a low and deadly voice,
looking up at her sister
.
“There is no point apportioning blame,” said Snape
smoothly
. “What is done, is done.”

“But not by you!” said Bellatrix furiously
. “No, you were once again absent
while the rest of us ran
dangers, were you not, Snape?”
“My orders were to remain behind,” said Snape.
“Perhaps you disagree with the Dark Lord, perhaps
you think that Dumbledore would not have noticed if
I had joined forces with the Death Eaters to fight the
Order of the Phoenix? And — for
give me — you speak
of dangers … you were facing six teenagers, were you
not?”
“They were joined, as you very well know
, by half of
the Order before long!” snarled Bellatrix. “And, while
we are on the subject of the Order
, you still claim you
cannot reveal the whereabouts of their headquarters,
don’
t you?”
“I am not the Secret-Keeper; I cannot speak the name
of the place. Y
ou understand how the enchantment
works, I think? The Dark Lord is satisfied with the
information I have passed him on the Order
. It led, as
www.ztcprep.com
perhaps you have guessed, to the recent capture and
murder of Emmeline V
ance, and it certainly helped
dispose of Sirius Black, though I give you full credit
for finishing him of
f.”
He inclined his head and toasted her
. Her expression
did not soften.
“Y
ou are avoiding my last question, Snape. Harry
Potter
. Y
ou could have killed him at any point in the
past five years. Y
ou have not done it. Why?”
“Have you discussed this matter with the Dark Lord?”
asked Snape.
“He … lately
, we … I am asking you, Snape!”
P a g e

“If I had murdered Harry Potter
, the Dark Lord could not have used his
blood to regenerate, making him
invincible —”
“Y
ou claim you foresaw his use of the boy!” she
jeered.
“I do not claim it; I had no idea of his plans; I have
already confessed that I thought the Dark Lord dead.
www.ztcprep.com
I am merely trying to explain why the Dark Lord is
not sorry that Potter survived, at least until a year
ago. …”
“But why did you keep him alive?”
“Have you not understood me? It was only
Dumbledore’
s protection that was keeping me out of
Azkaban! Do you disagree that murdering his favorite
student might have turned him against me? But there
was more to it than that. I should remind you that
when Potter first arrived at Hogwarts there were still
many stories circulating about him, rumors that he
himself was a great Dark wizard, which was how he
had survived the Dark Lord’
s attack. Indeed, many of
the Dark Lord’
s old followers thought Potter might be
a standard around which we could all rally once
more. I was curious, I admit it, and not at all inclined
to murder him the moment he set foot in the castle.
“Of course, it became apparent to me very quickly
that he had no extraordinary talent at all. He has
fought his way out of a number of tight corners by a
